I set out to design a new personal site that was incredibly simple, but also easy to use. I wanted to show a lot content, but stick to a one page layout. To do this I implemented a morphing button concept in the about section inspired by the wonderful [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/ "Codrops") & a sliding 'belt' in the work section inspired by the great [DevTips](https://youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners "DevTips").

I tried to establish a casual tone that was soft & not intimidating.
