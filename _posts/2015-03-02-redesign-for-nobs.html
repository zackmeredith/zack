<p>This project was attempt to create a new, modern look for the New Orleans Bike &amp; Board Shop. The original site had text that was incredibly hard to read and a carousel setup that offered little information without the user clicking through or waiting.</p>
<p><img class="post-pic-body" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nobs-og.png" alt="NOBS Original"></p>
<p>This homepage revision attempted to offer the user all the original information and more in an easier and more accessible way. </p>
<p><img class="post-pic-body" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nobs.png" alt="NOBS New Website Design"></p>
<p><img class="post-pic-body" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nobs-belowfold.png" alt="NOBS New Website Below the Fold"></p>
<p>This is definitely no more than a rough draft for the site. Filler text and the wonderful <a href="http://fillmurray.com/" title="Fill Murray">Fill Murray</a>, used for placeholder images, still line the page.</p>
<p>The color palette and other base styles could be changed easily because of the use of Sass variables for most of the styling and defining them all in a base stylesheet.</p>
<p>All of that being said, the client decided that they wanted to work towards an ecommerce site instead of one that focused on displaying what they had in a more crafted way. </p>
<p>What that means: This homepage won&#39;t be used for the shop and will instead be replaced by one that focuses more on a comfortable and engaging user experience for online shopping.</p>
