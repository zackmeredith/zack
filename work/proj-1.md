title: NOBS Website Redesign
---

This project was attempt to create a new, modern look for the New Orleans Bike & Board Shop. The original site had text that was incredibly hard to read and a carousel setup that offered little information without the user clicking through or waiting.

This homepage revision attempted to offer the user all the original information and more in an easier and more accessible way.

This is definitely no more than a rough draft for the site. Filler text and the wonderful [Fill Murray](http://fillmurray.com/ "Fill Murray"), used for placeholder images, still line the page.

The color palette and other base styles could be changed easily because of the use of Sass variables for most of the styling and defining them all in a base stylesheet.

All of that being said, the client decided that they wanted to work towards an ecommerce site instead of one that focused on displaying what they had in a more crafted way. 

What that means: This homepage won't be used for the shop and will instead be replaced by one that focuses more on a comfortable and engaging user experience for online shopping.
