              <p>My path to becoming a Designer & Developer began in a high school Computer Science course. It was there that I discovered the amazing things one could create with a few keystrokes & a little know-how. While my first project (a reimagination of the classic Pong) was far from what I would consider even passible design & coding work, it sparked my interest in what I strive to do now: create engaging & attractive things with computers.</p>
              <p>I considered a Computer Science degree, but my passion for music led me to Loyola University New Orleans to study Music Business. The program connected me with so many of the amazing people I now know and made it possible for me to tour the country with some of my best friends. Traveling across the United States has exposed me to so many fascinating people & the communities surrounding the creation of art. All while financing our new experiences by doing what we loved.</p>
              <p>The program also gave me the chance to start creating and maintaining a few websites. After a few courses in web technology I discovered that designing & developing websites was something that I truly loved. Since then I've spent countless hours reading & learning about ways to be creative & solve problems on the web. I am always looking for new techinques to better express my visions & to create more engaging works.</p>
