              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>My path to becoming a Designer/Developer began in a high school Computer Science course. It was there that I discovered the amazing things one could create with a few keystrokes & a little know-how. While my first project (a reimagination of the classic Pong) was far from what I would consider even passible design & coding work, it sparked my interest in what I love to do now. Creating engaging & attractive things with computers.</br></p><img src="assets/img/self-dark.jpg" alt="Self Guitar"/>
